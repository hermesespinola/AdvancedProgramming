The circuit of the race is made up of checkpoints. To complete one lap, your vehicle (pod) must pass through each checkpoints in order and back through the start. The first player to reach the starting checkpoint on the final lap wins.

The pods work as follows:

    - To pass a checkpoint, the center of a pod must be inside the radius of the checkpoint.
    - To move a pod, you must print a target destination point followed by a thrust value. Details of the protocol can be found further down.
    - The thrust value of a pod is its acceleration and must be between 0 and 100.
    - You can use 1 acceleration boost in the race, you need only replace the thrust value by the BOOST keyword.
